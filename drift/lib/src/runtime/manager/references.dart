/// Base class for the "WithReference" classes
///
/// When a user calls `withReferences` on a manager, the item is returned, along with an instance of this
/// class which contains getters for the referenced tables manager which are pre-filtered to the item.
/// So the following:
/// ```dart
/// final (department,refs) = await departments.filter((f) => f.id(5)).withReferences().getSingle()
/// final productsInDepartment = refs.products.get() // filter((f) => f.department(department.id)) is already applied
/// ```
/// is short for:
/// ```dart
/// final department = await departments.filter((f) => f.id(5)).getSingle()
/// final productsInDepartment = await products.filter((f) => f.department(department.id)).get()
/// ```
///
/// {@macro manager_internal_use_only}
///
/// # Prefetching
///
/// ### Problem
///
/// It's quite common that a user will want a model together with it's relations.
/// The simple option is to prefetch all of the products, and then run a 2nd request for each related department.
/// ```dart
/// final products = await products.withReferences().get()
/// for (final (product,refs) in products){
///   final department = await refs.departments.getSingle();
/// }
/// ```
/// The issue with the above code is that we could be setting ourselves up to do tons of queries.
///
/// ### Solution
///
/// There are two methods we use together to solve this.
/// Joins and Prefetches.
///
/// #### Join
///
/// For fields which are foreign keys to other tables, we can just use a join to select the related field and get it all in one query.
/// This is burdensome to do manually, but drift does it for you if you enable prefetching for a field.
/// There are many examples how to do this in the drift documentation
///
///
/// #### Prefetch
///
/// However, for reverse relations, we can't get it all in a single query.
/// We have to run 2 queries. Here is how it's done manually.
///
/// ```dart
/// final departments = await departments.get();
/// final departmentIds = departments.map((department)=> department.id);
/// final products = await products.filter((f)=> f.department.id.isIn(departmentIds)).get()
/// final departmentsWithProducts = departments.map((department)=>(department,products.where((product)=> product.department == department.id)));
/// ```
///
/// We get all the products ahead of time, and then manually return each department with it's products using a `where(...)` filter.
///
/// We will call both of these "prefetch" throughout.
///
///
/// ### Manager API
///
/// This is quite verbose, and the manager api seeks to solve this for drift users.
/// The API looks like this:
/// ```dart
/// products.withReferences((prefetch) => prefetch(department: true)).get()
/// ```
///
/// To do this there are a couple of things we need to do.
///
/// For references data we are getting via JOIN
///
/// 1. Before we even run a query with `products.withReferences((prefetch) => prefetch(department: true)).get()`, we need to put add a JOIN to this query.
/// 2. When we read back this result, we need to read the JOINed information back.
///
/// For referenced data we are getting with a prefetch:
///
/// 1. After we get all the results we need to run more queries, map the correct data, and inject it info each object.
///
/// We also have to do difference behavior depending of what was prefetched, so this is a pretty complex issue.
///
/// ### Implementation
///
/// We only need to do 2 things for this to work:
///
/// 1) Reference class
///
/// This class is kinda cool.
/// It stores a reference to the database, the table and a the original result of the query as a `TypedResult`, which is what drift uses to store the raw query.
/// But along with that, it has getters for prebuilt managers.
/// When `withReferences` is called, we return the dataclass, together with this.
///
/// To keep things simple for now, this is a reference class which has it's prefetching abilities removed
/// ```dart
/// final class $$ProductTableReferences
///     extends BaseReferences<_$TodoDb, $ProductTable, ProductData> {
///   $$ProductTableReferences(super.$_db, super.$_table, super.$_typedResult);
///
///   $$DepartmentTableProcessedTableManager? get department {
///     if ($_item.department == null) return null;
///     return  $$DepartmentTableTableManager($_db, $_db.department)
///         .filter((f) => f.id($_item.department!));
///  }
///
///   $$ListingTableProcessedTableManager get listings {
///     return  $$ListingTableTableManager($_db, $_db.listing)
///         .filter((f) => f.product.id($_item.id));
///   }
/// }
/// ```
/// You can see how this allow us to easily get managers which are configured special for this product.
///
/// However, imagine we added extra data to this `TypedResult` before, we could read it and put it in the new managers cache.
/// This is what the full code looks like for the reference class.
/// Keep in mind this class only reads data, we'll get to the writing soon.
///
///
/// ```dart
///
/// final class $$ProductTableReferences
///    extends BaseReferences<_$TodoDb, $ProductTable, ProductData> {
///  $$ProductTableReferences(super.$_db, super.$_table, super.$_typedResult);
///
///   /// When we do the join we will use this aliased table
///   static $DepartmentTable _departmentTable(_$TodoDb db) =>
///       db.department.createAlias(
///           $_aliasNameGenerator(db.product.department, db.department.id));
///
///   $$DepartmentTableProcessedTableManager? get department {
///     /// If we already know that this product has no department, we will return null
///     if ($_item.department == null) return null;
///     final manager = $$DepartmentTableTableManager($_db, $_db.department)
///         .filter((f) => f.id($_item.department!));
///
///     /// If we already joined the department table, then this will be the department for this product
///     final item = $_typedResult.readTableOrNull(_departmentTable($_db));
///     if (item == null) return manager;
///     return ProcessedTableManager(
///         manager.$state.copyWith(prefetchedData: [item]));
///   }
///   /// This is similar to [_departmentTable] , but fot the listings.
///   /// This is a reverse relation, so we won't be using this to create a joined query.
///   /// But we will still use it to read and write into the `TypedResult` (`TypedResult` is a glorified `Map`, it's key needs to be a certain kind of class [ResultSetImplementation] with a generic, that's all `MultiTypedResultKey` does)
///   static MultiTypedResultKey<$ListingTable, List<ListingData>> _listingsTable(
///           _$TodoDb db) =>
///       MultiTypedResultKey.fromTable(db.listing,
///           aliasName: $_aliasNameGenerator(db.product.id, db.listing.product));
///
///   $$ListingTableProcessedTableManager get listings {
///     final manager = $$ListingTableTableManager($_db, $_db.listing)
///         .filter((f) => f.product.id($_item.id));
///     /// If we have done any prefetches, these listings will be in the typed result
///     /// We will take them out and put them in the new manager
///     final cache = $_typedResult.readTableOrNull(_listingsTable($_db));
///     return ProcessedTableManager(
///         manager.$state.copyWith(prefetchedData: cache));
///   }
/// }
/// ```
/// ### Hooks
/// OK, we can see how we read references, but how does the manager actually fetch these results and add them to the `TypedResult` class?
/// For that we use the `PrefetchedHooks` class and some callbacks.
///
/// So let's start at the beginning.
/// ```
/// products.withReferences((prefetch) => prefetch(listings: true));
/// ```
/// This `prefetch` function is declared on the generated manager and returns a `PrefetchedHooks`.
/// Here is an example so we can walk through this
/// ```
/// prefetchHooksCallback: ({department = false, listings = false}) {
///           return PrefetchHooks(
///             /// This field holds a function which will add the join if the user adds it to the prefetch
///             addJoins: <
///                 /// The generics here are kinda messy,
///                 /// but it's declaring a function that takes a TableManagerState and returns a TableManagerState with some changes.
///                 T extends TableManagerState<
///                     dynamic,
///                     dynamic,

///               /// If the user did `prefetch(department: true)` then a join will be added to the query
///               if (department) {
