**Description**

Thanks for taking the time to file an issue for drift's documentation website or dartdocs!

If you are looking for information that you feel is not sufficiently explained on the
website (or too hard to find), please describe what the site is missing and, if possible,
where you think the information should be added.

If something on a page appears to be wrong or outdated, please include a link to
the relevant section and mention what didn't work (or possibly what should be
written instead).

**Aditional info**

Write down any aditional info/discussion for this issue. If you think the documentation issue may be related to your drift version, please include the versions of `drift` you're using.
Also, feel free to add screenshots or videos if they help explaining the documentation issue.
