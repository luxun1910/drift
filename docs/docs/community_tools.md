## Conflict-free replicated datatypes

Conflict-free replicated datatypes (CRDTs) enable synchronization and replication of data
even when offline.
The [sql\_crdt](https://pub.dev/packages/sql_crdt) package by Daniel Cachapa uses the
`sqlparser` package from the drift project transforms SQL queries at runtime to implement
CRDTs for databases.
The [drift\_crdt](https://pub.dev/packages/drift_crdt) package by Janez Å tupar provides a
wrapper around this for drift.

## Storage inspector

[Nicola Verbeeck](https://github.com/NicolaVerbeeck) wrote the `storage_inspector` packages, which
allow you to inspect your app's persistent data in JetBrains tools like IntelliJ or Android Studio.
This includes drift databases, but preferences or secure local storage are also supported.

- The general [`storage_inspector`](https://pub.dev/packages/storage_inspector) package on pub.
- The [IDEA plugin for your IDE](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/18231-local-storage-inspector).
- [drift support for `storage_inspector`](https://pub.dev/packages/drift_local_storage_inspector).

## drift_db_viewer

The [drift_db_viewer](https://pub.dev/packages/drift_db_viewer) package by [Koen Van Looveren](https://github.com/vanlooverenkoen)
is a package to view a moor or drift database in your Flutter app directly.
It includes a graphical user interface showing you all rows for each table. You can also filter
rows by columns that you've added to your tables.

Starting with Drift 2.13 and Flutter 3.16, this database viewer is also available in DevTools! Navigate to
the "Drift" tab in DevTools and select your database class to view your database in Flutter's DevTools.
No additional dependencies are needed for this.

## moor2csv

[Dhiman Seal](https://github.com/Dhi13man) wrote a package to export moor or drift databases as csv files.
The package is [on pub](https://pub.dev/packages/moor2csv).
